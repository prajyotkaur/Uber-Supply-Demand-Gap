# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap
Uber Supply Demand Gap

Problem : Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue. 
There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, can be either completed, canceled by the driver or no cars are available

Results Expected
Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
Hint: Create plots to visualize the frequency of requests that get canceled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport/airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots
Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
 Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
